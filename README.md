# Ear-FineTunning

Project to try to create a Neural Network fine-tunning one of the models that Keras have. The objective of the NN will be classification given a ear image.

It consists in 3 parts:
  1. Train model: Where the model(s) are trained and obtained its metrics
  2. Loading the models already trained: Where the models already trained are compared between them.
  3. Try with your photos: Where it's possible to check for an unseen photo of one of the classes of the database.
